## **Notes**

To compile Open3D, use these following commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DBUILD_PYTHON_MODULE=OFF -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DBUILD_WEBRTC=OFF -DBUILD_CUDA_MODULE=ON -DBUILD_SYCL_MODULE=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:/open3d_install"
cmake --build . --config Release --target ALL_BUILD
cmake --build . --config Release --target INSTALL
```

As the debug version of Open3D is quite large, it is recommended to use the release version.
But if you want it, as I couldn't upload it to Github, here it is: [Open3D Debug](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PbJzS16-kilIeqCgm4MRfokHYLtWN9wt/view?usp=sharing)
